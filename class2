2) Single User - Multitasking Operating System Ex: win-98, Win-7
3) Multi User - Multitasking Operating System Ex: Unix, Linux

Origin of UNIX?
First Code of the OS, Configured from C Launguage, 1969 Dennis Ritch and Ken Thomson at & Labs

64 OS intruduced from UNIX

Sun 10Develop Unix====> Solaris OS + Hardware + support	Medium	60$	75%availabulity
IBM 10Developers Unix ====> AIX + Hardware + support	High	100$	100%availabulity
HP 10Developers Unix =====> HpUx + Hardware + support   Cheep	30$	50%availabulity

Linus Thorvalds Unix ========> Linux 1991

Origin of Linux?
RedHat 10Developer Linux ===> RedHat Linux OS + HP + support
Fedora 10Developer Linux ===> Fedora
Kali 10Developer Linux ===> Kali Linux
Suse 10Developer Linux ===> SuseLinux
Oracle 10Developer Linux ===> Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL)

Server Environments:
Production: Live application in internet and will generate revenew
Testing: Non-Live application which is used for test the modifications and enhansments
Development: To do the Troubleshooing and develop new features

ARCHITECTURE OF UNIX/Linux/OS?
1) Hardware, 2) OS/Kernel/system, 3) SHell, 4) Utilities 5) Users
