3) reboot the server and catch at grub menu
4) edit the grub and modify kernel image line with "rd.break"
5) need to switch harddisk image by running below command
	# chroot /sysroot
6) need to run below command to remount root file system in read-write
	# mount -o remount,rw /
7) perform root password reset
	# cp /etc/shadow /etc/shadow.04092025
	# passwd -S root ===> if the account shows locked then need to release
	# passwd -U root 
	# passwd root ===> default passwd
8) reboot the server and check the root access
